# Samantha Butler | Full Stack Software Electrical Engineer 


Have you ever been excited that something has broken down and you now have a new problem to solve?! I have! In fact, I live for problem solving through creative out of the box thinking. I love finding ways to connect my love for hardware with my software capabilites. I challenge myself to continually learn new things by striving to incorporate new technologies into every new project I tackle.I have experience building full stack web applications using but not limited to JavaScript, Python, C++, HTML / CSS, and Sequelize and SQLAlchemy.

The fullfillment I feel once completing a project only makes me want to jump right back into developing the next latest and greatest application. If you have the same passion for embedded systems, AI, robotics, autonomous vehicles, or anything within that scope I would love to be part of your developing journey!
